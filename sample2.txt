About Local AI Models

This chatbot uses several local AI models:

1. Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   - Creates numerical representations of text
   - Used for semantic search
   - Runs completely offline

2. Optional LLM Model: Orca Mini 3B
   - Generates human-like responses
   - Requires separate download
   - Can be used for enhanced answers

Without the LLM model, the system will show you the most relevant text passages from your documents instead of generating new answers.

You can download the LLM model from the GPT4All website if you want generated responses.
